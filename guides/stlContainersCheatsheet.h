//week 1: get schedule together, discuss goals 
//week 2: define what containers do, their place in data structures
//week 3: simple implementations - use every single function in the library
//week 4: running times of functions, how to iterate through containers

//stl container tools
unordered_map<type1, type2>
vector <type> 
map<type1, type2>
queue<type> //fifo
stack<type> //filo
list<type> 
unordered_set<type> //constant insert/lookup  
priority_queue<type> //logn insert
set<type> //binary search trees

//	**start making list of companies, make sure everyone is on the same sites, apply to companies**

//week 5: start concepts-> go through list of concepts maybe add a few 
//week 6: define how to implement concepts with containers
//week 7: go through interview questions, add to algorithm list, write down everyone's weak points
//week 8: go through interview questions, add to algorithm list, write down everyone's weak points
//week 9: go through interview questions, add to algorithm list, write down everyone's weak points
//week 10: go through interview questions, add to algorithm list, write down everyone's weak points
//week 11+: repeat until we got opportunities
